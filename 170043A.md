### 1. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are software scripts that are deployed on a blockcahin. They get automatically executed when some previously determined terms and conditions are fulfilled. Smart contracts enable different parties to perform trusted transaction without the need of a third party like legal officers.

### 2. Proof of Stake

It is a consensus mechanism. Participants need to "stake" (put forward with risk) some amount of coins to become a validator. Validators are randomly chosen among those who have staked. When some number of validators validate a new transaction it is added to the blockchain. Unlike proog of work, this does not require large amounts of computations.
